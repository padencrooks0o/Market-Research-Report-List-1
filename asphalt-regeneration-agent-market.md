<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Asphalt Regeneration Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat-In-Place Regeneration</li><li>Plant Mix Hot Regeneration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Asphalt Regeneration Agent market comprises two primary types: Heat-In-Place Regeneration and Plant Mix Hot Regeneration. Heat-In-Place Regeneration involves reheating existing asphalt pavement on-site, allowing for the rejuvenation of aging materials without complete removal. This method is efficient and minimizes disruption. In contrast, Plant Mix Hot Regeneration occurs at asphalt production facilities, where old asphalt is combined with new materials and rejuvenators, producing a fresh mix for use in paving projects. Both methods enhance sustainability and reduce waste in road construction.</p></p>
